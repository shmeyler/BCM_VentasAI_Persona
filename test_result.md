# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Successfully tested the navigation from homepage to persona wizard for the multi-source data workflow. The multi-source data card is correctly displayed on the homepage and can be selected. Clicking the 'Next' button properly creates a persona via API call with the 'multi_source_data' method and navigates to the persona wizard with the correct URL parameters. The PersonaWizard component loads properly with the Basic Info step displayed. All debug logs confirm the correct flow: card selection, Next button click, API call, and navigation. The complete flow from homepage to persona wizard works as expected. The issue reported previously has been resolved."

    message: "Comprehensive testing of the multi-source data persona generation workflow completed. Created a test with realistic demographic data (age: 25-40, gender: Female, income: $50,000-$75,000, location: Urban, occupation: Marketing Professional, social platforms: Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn). Successfully uploaded the data, created a persona with multi_source_data starting method, and generated the final persona with AI insights using the use_multi_source_data=true parameter. Verified that the generated persona correctly uses the uploaded demographic data to create intelligent insights. The AI insights include Millennial-specific traits like 'Tech-savvy', 'Value-conscious', and 'Experience-focused'. Recommendations include platform-specific advice for Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn. Communication style is correctly set to 'Direct, informative, and value-focused communication' for Millennials. Pain points include Millennial-specific issues like 'Time constraints due to busy lifestyle'. The image generation successfully uses the demographic data to create an appropriate persona image. The updated personas/{id}/generate endpoint correctly extracts demographics from stored persona data and generates AI insights based on the actual uploaded demographics. All tests passed with 100% of verification criteria met."

    message: "Tested the BCM VentasAI Persona Generator workflow to identify the exact issues reported by users. The application successfully navigates from the homepage to the persona creation wizard, and the step indicator correctly shows all 7 steps in the workflow (Basic Info, Resonate Data, SparkToro Data, SEMRush Data, Buzzabout.ai Data, Data Integration, and AI Persona Generation). Based on code analysis, I've identified two potential issues: 1) In the Data Integration step, the component relies on dataSources.resonate.uploaded being true and makes an API call to /api/personas/integrate-data. If this API call fails or returns empty data, it would show 0 demographic insights. 2) In the AI Persona Generation step, the startAIGeneration function makes an API call to /api/personas/{id}/generate. If this API call fails (possibly due to OpenAI API key issues or invalid data), it would show an error on the final screen. These issues are likely related to data processing or API integration problems rather than UI navigation issues."
